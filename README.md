### Case
Our application starts with the end user filling in a public application form. The user who fills in the form is given a code to track his/her application. From the application status page, the user can check whether the application has been resolved with this code.

Authorized users can view incoming applications from a screen that can be accessed with a username and password, write answers to unanswered applications and update the status as resolved / canceled / pending, etc. If necessary, they can access old records.
